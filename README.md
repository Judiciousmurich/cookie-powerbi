# Power BI Project - Sales Forecasting

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Power BI for predictive sales forecasting, data analysis, and creating interactive dashboards. It leverages historical sales data, applies data preprocessing, and uses predictive modeling techniques to forecast future sales trends.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following main components:

- **Data**: Contains raw sales data and transformed datasets used for analysis.
- **Scripts**: Includes scripts for data cleaning, transformation, and API integration (if applicable).
- **Visuals**: Stores Power BI visuals and reports used in the final dashboard.
- **PowerBIReport**: Contains the Power BI Desktop report file (.pbix) for the analysis and visualizations.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop**: Used for data analysis and building visualizations.
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation.
- **DAX**: Used for advanced calculations and predictive modeling.
- **Python (optional)**: For predictive sales forecasting with fbprophet or other forecasting libraries.
- **APIs**: For fetching real-time data (if applicable).

## Steps to Reproduce

### 1. Data Import and Cleaning
- Import the historical sales data into Power BI.
- Clean the data using Power Query: remove duplicates, filter irrelevant data, and merge datasets.

### 2. Predictive Modeling
- Use DAX functions to create time series forecasting models for predicting future sales.
- Alternatively, use Python (if integrated) to apply forecasting techniques such as fbprophet.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Create interactive visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and slicers to display sales data.
- Build a dashboard by arranging the visuals to provide a comprehensive view of sales performance.

### 4. Publishing and Sharing
- Publish the Power BI report to the Power BI service.
- Share the dashboard with stakeholders via the Power BI service, applying necessary permissions.

## Expected Outcomes
- Proficiency in data cleaning and transformation with Power Query.
- Experience with predictive modeling using DAX and/or Python.
- Creation of interactive and insightful sales visualizations.
- Knowledge of sharing Power BI reports and dashboards with stakeholders.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of additional external data sources for more accurate forecasting.
- Improved predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms.
- Custom Power BI visuals for enhanced data presentation.
